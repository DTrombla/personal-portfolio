# personal-portfolio
This project is a framework for what will be my portfolio.

index.html is the primary html file for this site and contains a picture of me and will contain a short bio as well.

portfolio.html is a page on the site where I assume screenshots of various projects will be, which, when clicked on, will take you to the project page itself in a seperate tab.

contact.html is a page on the site that can be used to contact me presumably through email, using form elements.

At the top of every page on the site is a nav-bar that has my name on the very left that, when clicked on, will take you to the index.html or "about me" page. On the right of the nav-bar are three links that will take you to the portfolio page, the contact page, and the about me page, when clicked. In the mobile view of the site these three links are compressed into a button that when pressed reveals a collapsable dropdown menu that contains the links. At all times the link to the page that you are currently on will be highlighted to make navigating the site easier.

All pages are responsive and function correctly and seamlessly at all device widths.

At the bottom of every page is a small footer containing a small copyright claim from Duncan Trombla inc., additionally when the words "Duncan Trombla" are clicked you will be taken back to the index.html or "about me" page.

Please enjoy my website.
